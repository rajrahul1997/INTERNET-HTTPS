# INTERNET-HTTPS
HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a protocol for securing the communication between two systems e.g. the browser and the web server.
https transfers data in the encrypted format. Thus, https prevents hackers from reading and modifying the data during the transfer between the browser and the web server. Even if hackers manage to intercept the communication, they will not be able to use it because the message is encrypted.
HTTPS established an encrypted link between the browser and the web server using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. 
TLS is the new version of SSL.
